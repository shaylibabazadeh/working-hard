#I will then convert Datetime and Date_posted columns into appropriate formats

#Then I am  going to classify the hoax comments 
#I have decided that if a comment line has # then it is a hoax comment 
#I then went through using an ifelse() statement and if a line had # in it then
#TRUE was stated in the new column named is_hoax, otherwise that column says FALSE

#the new dataset

#Next I am going to check the data quality (missingness, format, range etc) of the "duration seconds" column. 
#Explain what kinds of problems you have identified and how you chose to deal with them, in your comments.

#if those entries should be omitted

#I don't think for this dataset it is necessary to have an hours column because most of the sightings are in shorter periods of time

#Here, I have reformatted the previous data into a dataset and removed the column duration.hours.min due to ambiguity
